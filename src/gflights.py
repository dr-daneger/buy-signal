"""Google Flights data via the unofficial fast-flights scraper.

Two roles in the hybrid setup:
  - full search source: primary when Amadeus keys are absent, and automatic
    backfill for any query Amadeus returns empty
  - spot-check: cross-checks top-ranked cities against what Ali would see in
    the browser (stored as source 'gflights-check' so it never mixes into
    the ranking data)

Scraping is brittle by nature, so fetch modes are tried in order per query:
  1. "common"  — plain HTTP fetch of the lite page; fast, works for big routes
  2. "local"   — own headless Chromium via Playwright; handles routes the lite
                 page won't render (BOD, LIS, NCE, ...). Needs
                 `pip install playwright && playwright install chromium`.
  3. hosted fallback service — only when Playwright is missing; it is
                 token-rate-limited and unreliable.
Failures degrade to "no data for that query" instead of a failed sweep.

NOTE: Google Flights displays the total price for the whole party, so the
scraped number is used as-is.
